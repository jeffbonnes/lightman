[Spooky.js](https://github.com/WaterfallEngineering/SpookyJS) is the node flavor of [Casper.js](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs), which is a higher level library for [Phantom.js](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)! YIKES.  Should you still want to install:\r\n\r\n\r\n    npm install -g lightman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Make sure to install CasperJS/PhantomJS with:  \r\n\r\n    brew install casperjs\r\n\r\n\r\nLightman usage:\r\n\r\n````\r\nUsage: lightman [options] <command>\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n  -h, --help                       output usage information\r\n  -V, --version                    output the version number\r\n  -t, --team [team id]             Use team id\r\n  -c, --csr [csr file]             Use csr file\r\n  -bn, --bundlename [bundle name]  Use bundle name\r\n  -bi, --bundleid [bundle id]      Use bundle id\r\n  -dn, --devicename [device name]  Use device nam\r\n  -di, --deviceid [device id]      Use device id\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n\r\n  login - logs you in (saves to keychain)\r\n  logout\r\n  whoami - who am i logged in as?\r\n  cert:create:dev - create development certificate\r\n  cert:create:dist - create distribution certificate\r\n  appid:create - create app id\r\n  appid:configure:push - configure app id for push\r\n  device:addid - add device id\r\n  team:list - list teams you belong to\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Other Stuff:\r\n\r\n* Based on [Cupertino](https://github.com/mattt/cupertino) by [mattt](https://github.com/mattt), but you know, not ruby.\r\n* I also include some shell scripts for doing things like:\r\n  * creating a CSR\r\n  * importing a certificate\r\n  * exporting a p12 certificate\r\n* Lightman was created as part of the [EverTrue](http://www.evertrue.com) 2013 winter hackathon.\r\n* I prefer working in objective-C, this javascript stuff scares me.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
